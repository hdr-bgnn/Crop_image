# Crop_image
Small repository to store the cropping step of the BGNN Fish project 
This repo is linked to main repo [BGNN_Snakemake](https://github.com/hdr-bgnn/BGNN_Snakemake) that encompasses a complete analysis workflow. It contained the code for the "Cropping" part [see here](https://github.com/hdr-bgnn/BGNN_Snakemake/blob/main/Picture_for_Documentation/Workflow_stage_1.png)

## 1 - Short description

We use raw fish image [available at Tulane]() and Metadata json file generated by [Drexel_metadata generator](https://github.com/hdr-bgnn/drexel_metadata) to crop the fish out of a more complexe image.
The metadata json file contained the bounding box of the fish which use to crop the fish. We add a 10% increase in size around the fish in case the metadata bounding box cut out the extremity of the fish. The Cropped image will be used later by segmentation algorithm such as [trait_segmenation](https://github.com/hdr-bgnn/BGNN-trait-segmentation)
